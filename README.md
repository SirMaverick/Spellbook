# Spellbook

Spellbook has to be opened in unity or an Android built.

To start Spellbook in unity you'll have to open the handshake scene. This will only work if your IP has been listed in the server where the Handshake scene is being configured.
Once you've gone through the handshake scene, make sure you have the right MoCap Suit and objects in the area.

Put on the Gear VR and start casting some spells.

In the trailer you can see how to cast the spells and how the game works.
